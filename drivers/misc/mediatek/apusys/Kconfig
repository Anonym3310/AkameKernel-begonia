config MTK_APUSYS_SUPPORT
	bool "APUSYS driver"
	help
	  For Mediatek APUSYS features, such as APUSYS driver
	  APUSYS power, APUSYS QoS,
	  CONFIG_MTK_APUSYS defines
	  if the APUSYS driver should be
	  built in or not

config MTK_APUSYS_MDLA_SUPPORT
	bool "MDLA driver"
	help
	  Support deep neural network calculation using
	  hardware accelerator. Customers and third party
	  could use MDLA to develop feature and algorithm
	  by themselves.

config MTK_APUSYS_VPU
	bool "VPU driver"
	select REMOTEPROC
	help
	  Support image processing using VPU hardware.
	  Customers and third party could use VPU to develop
	  feature and algorithm by themselves. There is better
	  performance and power if image process algorithm
	  land on VPU instead of CPU/GPU.

config MTK_APUSYS_VPU_DEBUG
	bool "VPU Debug"
	depends on MTK_APUSYS_VPU
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Enable debug facilities of VPU, such as
	  kernel logs, register dumps, device logs,
	  VPU jtag functions, and MET trace.
	  Disable, if you don't need them.
