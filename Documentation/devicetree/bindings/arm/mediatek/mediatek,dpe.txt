Mediatek imgsys controller
============================

The Mediatek imgsys controller provides various clocks to the system.

Required Properties:

- compatible: Should be one of:
	- "mediatek,mt2701-imgsys", "syscon"
	- "mediatek,mt6797-imgsys", "syscon"
	- "mediatek,mt8173-imgsys", "syscon"
- #clock-cells: Must be 1

The imgsys controller uses the common clk binding from
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
The available clocks are defined in dt-bindings/clock/mt*-clk.h.

Example:

dpe@15028000 {
	compatible = "mediatek,dpe";
	reg = <0 0x15028000 0 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 271 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
	clocks = <&imgsys CLK_IMG_DPE>;
	clock-names = "DPE_CG_IMG_DPE";
};
